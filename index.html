        <p>By utilizing these <b>5 core</b> mind sets, Programmers will take a <em>complicated 
        scope</em> of work

        <b>Large Scale</b> problems are broken into <em>smaller more manageable pieces</em> to be 
        solved, problemsthat have <em>similar traits</em> can be  resolved via <b>Abstract thinking</b>, 
        and the overall understanding of <em>how Computers</em> must be given the <b>correct

        Once the near final product has been created, it must be tested, and debugged. By

        access all of these documents (Videos, Web sites, Social Media, ect.) HTML’s basic structure 
        is made up of <b>3 core things</b>.
